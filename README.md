# Ruby on Rails 6 with Bootstrap Template

It turns out that getting a barebones version of Rails 6 with Webpack
and the latest Bootstrap installed isn't as easy as it may seem.

This is a template to get you going. It mostly follows
the
[Go Rails tutorial here](https://gorails.com/episodes/how-to-use-bootstrap-with-webpack-and-rails),
but with some changes to `app/javascripts/packs/application.js` to get
things working.
